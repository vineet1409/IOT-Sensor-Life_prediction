# Smart Building Automation (Sensor-fault-Detection)
As part of the smart building automation, Zigbee-based end-devices such as THL (temperature, humidity, and light) sensors are used to automatically adjust room temperature or light based on their readings. These sensors were, however, subjected to battery drain, and hence their lifecycle was compromised. 

The team was endowed with the responsibility of creating an end-to-end ML pipeline with cloud deployment to predict the sensorâ€™s lifecycle (whether endangered or working normally), thereby reducing the cost of frequent setup and installation in buildings
